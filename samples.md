# Bach Chorale

Like most melody choralization systems trained on JSB Chorales, DeepChoir can reproduce the style of Bach. This is an example of a rechoralization of **Helft mir Gotts GÃ¼te preisen** (A thanksgiving and prayer for the new year), the alto, tenor and bass are generated by DeepChoir (harmonicity=0.5, polyphonicity=0.5).

# Famous Tune
To give you a better idea of what DeepChoir is capable of, we further rechoralized a famous melody, **Twinkle Twinkle Little Star**. We manually harmonized this melody to a Baroque style chord progression, generated using a setting of harmonicity=0.4 and polyphonicity=0.6.

# Folk Song
With chord conditioning and the improved density sampling, DeepChoir is capable of generating music that is different from the typical Bach style. The melody and chord progressions below are taken from the **ashover1** (A and A's Waltz) which is the first piece on the [Nottingham Lead Sheet Dataset](https://github.com/sander-wood/autoharmonizer). To demonstrate the improved density sampling capabilities, two different configurations of DeepChoir are used for its choralization.

# Symphony

"AI Maria" is generated by DeepChoir based on "Ave Maria", whose melody is composed by Charles Gounod, and the piano accompaniment is from Prelude No. 1 in C major, BWV 846. This music is a soulful homage to classical music, fulfilled with baroque elements, which was conceived as a genuine collaboration between humans and machines spanning centuries.

The composition of polyphonic chorale music in the style of J.S. Bach has represented a major challenge in automatic music composition over the last decades. Although previous neural network-based systems can effectively generate an appropriate chorale, none of them can generate chorales based on given chord progressions. To achieve chord-conditioned melody choralization, we propose DeepChoir. It is a melody choralization system that trained on Chordified J.S. Bach Chorales Dataset (with 366 chorales), and can generate a four-part SATB choir for a given melody and its corresponding chord progression.

This music is created as follows. We first chordify the piano accompaniment part which is composed by J.S Bach to get its chord progression. DeepChoir then generates a four-part SATB choir based on the extracted chord progression and the melody composed by Gounod. Finally, we rearrange the generated choir into a symphony and name it "AI Maria".

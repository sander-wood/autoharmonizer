# Discrimination Test

In this test, you will first choose a setting of DeepChoir for comparison with Bach and then click on the "show" button to start the test. 

You need to determine whether the ten chorales randomly selected are generated by the machine (all melodies are not machine-generated).

In addition to the audio, you can click on "Score" to view the corresponding music score for the audio.

Good luck!

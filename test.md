# Discrimination Test

In this test, you will first choose the melody harmonization system for comparison with humans and then determine whether the five chord progressions randomly selected are generated by the machine (the number of chords generated by the machine is also random).

In addition to the audio, you can click on "Score" under each question to view the corresponding music score for the audio.

Good luck!
